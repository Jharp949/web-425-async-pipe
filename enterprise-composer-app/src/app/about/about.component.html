        Bedřich Smetana, (born March 2, 1824, Leitomischl, Bohemia, Austrian Empire
        [now Litomyšl, Czech Republic]—died May 12, 1884, Prague), Bohemian composer of operas and
        symphonic poems, founder of the Czech national school of music. He was the first truly important
        Bohemian nationalist composer. Smetana studied music under his father, an amateur violinist.
        He early took up piano under a professional teacher and performed in public at the age of six.
        He continued his studies and later became music teacher to the family of Leopold, Count von Thun.
        Encouraged by Franz Liszt he opened a piano school in Prague in 1848 and the next year married the
        pianist Kateřina Kolářová. In 1856 he wrote his first symphonic poems and in the same year was
        appointed conductor of the philharmonic society of Gothenburg (Sweden), where he remained until 1861.
        He then returned to Prague, where he played the leading part in the establishment of the national
        opera house.
